# Comment
When writing a program, there are times when it becomes necessary to include comments. For example, comments are used to explain the purpose and behavior of a function, or to leave notes for fellow programmers who are collaborating on the development of the program. Comments serve various purposes and are essential when writing a program for reasons like these.

Therefore, woojin also supports comments. The way to write comments in woojin is not different from other common programming languages. In woojin, comments start with two forward slashes (//). Comments continue from the starting point until the end of the line. Here is an example of how to write a simple comment in woojin:
```woojin
// Hello, I am a Comment!!
```
The comment is ignored by the compiler(Interpreter) and serves as a way to add explanatory or informative notes within the code.
