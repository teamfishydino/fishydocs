Now, it seems like a good time to explore how to receive user input. There will come a time when you want to create a program that takes user input and processes it. Let's consider the example of creating a simple console-based chat program. First, we would need to receive user authentication information. Additionally, we would need to handle various commands such as displaying the list of channels, sending private messages to specific users, creating chat rooms, and joining chat rooms.

To receive user input in woojin, you can use the input keyword followed by a prompt message. The user's input will be stored as a string. Here's an example of receiving user authentication information:
```woojin
let username = input("Enter your username: ");
let password = input("Enter your password: ");
```
In the above code, the input keyword prompts the user to enter their username and password. The input provided by the user will be stored in the username and password variables as strings.

You can extend this concept to handle various commands and functionalities in your chat program, parsing and processing the user's input accordingly.
